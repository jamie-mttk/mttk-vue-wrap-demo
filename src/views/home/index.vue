    <h3>What is this project do?</h3>
    Normally a vue component is wrapped as a Single-File Component(SFC,with .vue extention) which has template/script/styles inside.<br>
    The idea of this project is to wrap all with pure java script. It is an alternative way but the target is NOT to replace SFC. 
    I suppose it is a good idea in some use cases.

    <h3>Quick start</h3>
    Please go through the samples one by one.<br>
    The samples are based on <a href="https://element-plus.gitee.io/" target="_blank">element-plus </a><br>
    But this method also applies to other component libraries.<br>
